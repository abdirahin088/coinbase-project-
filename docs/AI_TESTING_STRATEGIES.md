\# AI-Assisted Testing Strategies



> Essential approaches to testing AI-generated crypto applications with automated test generation



\## Overview



When you're building crypto apps with AI assistance, testing is very important (especially around wallets, transactions, and network connections). The good news is you can use AI to help write tests quickly, then improve them as needed.



\## Types of tests



\### Unit tests



These tests check individual pieces of code in isolation, like testing a single function or component.



```

"Generate unit tests for:

Code: \[paste]

Framework: \[Jest/Vitest + RTL]

Cover: interactions, error states, loading.

Mock: wallet/RPC as needed."

```



\### Integration tests



Integration tests check how different parts of your app work together - like how your wallet component talks to your transaction component.



```

"Create integration tests for flow:

App: \[embedded wallet/DeFi]

Steps: \[list]

Cover: happy path, wallet disconnect, tx failure, state sync."

```



\### End-to-end tests



End-to-end tests check complete user flows in a real browser or mobile app - like a user connecting their wallet, sending money, and seeing the confirmation.



```

"Design E2E tests:

Journeys: \[onboarding, send, swap]

Tool: \[Playwright/Cypress]

Include: error handling, mobile, cross-browser, wallet mock."

```



\### Mobile testing



When building embedded wallet or mobile-first crypto apps, testing on actual devices is crucial for catching touch interactions, mobile wallet connections, and performance issues.



\*\*\[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs) for mobile testing:\*\*



\* Creates secure HTTPS tunnels to your local development server

\* Allows testing your local app on real mobile devices

\* Essential for testing mobile wallet integrations and embedded wallet flows



```bash  theme={null}

\# Install and start ngrok tunnel

npm install -g ngrok

ngrok http 3000



\# Use the generated HTTPS URL to test on mobile devices

```



This is particularly useful for:



\* Testing embedded wallet flows on mobile browsers

\* Sharing development builds with stakeholders

\* Testing mobile-specific wallet connection flows



\## What to test in crypto apps



\### Wallet connection



Test how your app handles wallet states to prevent connection bugs and confused users.



\* Disconnected → loading → connected/failed (what UI shows in each state?)

\* User rejection handling (does app show clear error when user denies connection?)

\* Network switching prompts (what if user is on wrong network?)



```

"Generate wallet connection tests for my \[embedded/external] wallet app:



Test wallet state transitions:

\- Disconnected → loading → connected/failed (UI shows each state clearly)

\- User rejection handling (clear error when user denies connection)

\- Network switching prompts (when user is on wrong network)



Include: React Testing Library, Jest, wallet provider mocks"

```



\### Transactions



Test every step from user input to confirmation to catch gas failures and stuck transactions.



\* Validate inputs and formatting

\* Estimate gas (+buffers) and submit

\* Track status; handle success/failure

\* Surface user feedback/state updates



```

"Create transaction testing suite for my crypto app:



Test every step from user input to confirmation:

\- Validate inputs and formatting

\- Estimate gas (+buffers) and submit

\- Track status; handle success/failure

\- Surface user feedback/state updates



Focus on catching gas failures and stuck transactions.



Framework: \[Jest/Vitest], mock blockchain calls"

```



\### Network handling



Test multi-chain behavior and resilience when users are on wrong networks or RPCs fail.



\* Detect and switch networks

\* RPC failover

\* Confirmations and sync across changes



```

"Generate network handling tests for multi-chain app:



Test multi-chain behavior and resilience:

\- Detect and switch networks

\- RPC failover

\- Confirmations and sync across changes



Handle scenarios when users are on wrong networks or RPCs fail.



Mock: RPC responses, network switches, provider events"

```



\## What to mock



\* Wallet provider (connect, sign, send, switch, events)

\* RPC calls (balances, gas, receipts)

\* Contract calls (read/write)

\* Transaction states (pending/success/fail)

\* Network changes and errors



\## Testing approaches



\### Test-first approach



You can use the established Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology with AI assistance. TDD means writing tests before you write the actual code - it helps clarify what you're building and catches bugs early.



```

"Write failing tests for \[feature] from requirements, then implement minimal pass, then refactor with tests green."

```



\### Running tests automatically



Set up your code pipeline to run tests automatically when you make changes - this catches problems before they reach users.



```

"Generate CI config to run unit, integration, E2E on PR with cache and artifacts."

```



\### Learning from bugs



When you fix a bug, write a test for it so the same problem doesn't happen again.



```

"From bug \[desc], generate tests that reproduce failure, verify fix, and guard similar cases."

```



\## Best practices



\### Write clear test checks



Make your test assertions specific and helpful - when a test fails, you should immediately understand what went wrong.



```javascript  theme={null}

// Good: Specific, meaningful assertions

expect(walletState.isConnected).toBe(true);

expect(walletState.address).toMatch(/^0x\[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$/);

expect(transactionResult.hash).toBeDefined();



// Better: Custom matchers for crypto operations

expect(transaction).toBeValidTransaction();

expect(walletAddress).toBeValidEthereumAddress();

```



\### Create good test data



Use realistic test data that covers common scenarios and edge cases, but keep it simple enough to understand.



```

"Generate realistic test data for crypto testing:



Data types: \[wallets, transactions, tokens, prices]

Scenarios: \[success cases, edge cases, errors]

Format: \[TypeScript types, JSON fixtures]



Create data covering all scenarios with realistic blockchain data."

```
