\# Debugging AI-Generated Code



\## Overview



When you're building crypto apps with AI help, things often go wrong with wallets, network connections, and transactions. This guide shows you a simple, step-by-step way to debug these issues.



\*\*Here's how to debug effectively using AI:\*\*



\* \*\*Isolate\*\*: Create a simple example that shows the exact problem

\* \*\*Analyze\*\*: Give the AI context about your app and what you were trying to do

\* \*\*Fix\*\*: Ask for a solution that's secure and handles edge cases

\* \*\*Prevent\*\*: Get tests written so this bug doesn't happen again



\## Debug prompt template



\*\*Here's a template you can copy and fill in:\*\*



```

"Debug this issue in my \[app type]:



Error: \[exact message]

Expected vs Actual: \[one line]

Environment: \[browser/network/wallet]



Minimal code:

\[paste tiny repro]



Please provide:

1\) Likely root cause(s)

2\) Corrected code

3\) Safer pattern to avoid this

4\) Tests to prevent regression (framework: \[Jest/Vitest])"

```



\## Process



<Steps>

&nbsp; <Step title="1. Isolate">

&nbsp;   \*\*Copy this prompt:\*\*



&nbsp;   ```

&nbsp;   "Issue with \[functionality]:



&nbsp;   Expected: \[expected behavior]

&nbsp;   Actual: \[actual behavior]

&nbsp;   Error: \[exact error message]

&nbsp;   Environment: \[browser/network/wallet]



&nbsp;   Minimal code: \[paste minimal example]"

&nbsp;   ```

&nbsp; </Step>



&nbsp; <Step title="2. Analyze">

&nbsp;   \*\*Copy this prompt:\*\*



&nbsp;   ```

&nbsp;   "Context for this issue:



&nbsp;   App type: \[wallet/DeFi/trading]

&nbsp;   User flow: \[what user was doing]

&nbsp;   Recent changes: \[what changed]

&nbsp;   Similar working code: \[paste if any]



&nbsp;   Could any of these factors contribute?"

&nbsp;   ```

&nbsp; </Step>



&nbsp; <Step title="3. Fix">

&nbsp;   \*\*Copy this prompt:\*\*



&nbsp;   ```

&nbsp;   "Need a solution that:

&nbsp;   1. Fixes the immediate issue

&nbsp;   2. Follows security best practices

&nbsp;   3. Handles edge cases like \[specific cases]

&nbsp;   4. Integrates with existing patterns



&nbsp;   Provide corrected code with explanations."

&nbsp;   ```

&nbsp; </Step>



&nbsp; <Step title="4. Prevent">

&nbsp;   \*\*Copy this prompt:\*\*



&nbsp;   ```

&nbsp;   "Create tests for this fix:



&nbsp;   Fixed code: \[paste solution]

&nbsp;   Test scenarios: \[edge cases to cover]

&nbsp;   Framework: \[Jest/Vitest]



&nbsp;   Generate tests covering the bug and related cases."

&nbsp;   ```

&nbsp; </Step>

</Steps>



\## How to prevent bugs



\### Always review AI code



\*\*Use this prompt to get the AI to check its own work:\*\*



```

"Review your generated code for:

\- Common crypto development mistakes

\- Security vulnerabilities  

\- Performance issues

\- Integration problems



Provide critical analysis and improvements."

```



\### Generate tests with code



\*\*Ask for tests when you request features:\*\*



```

"Generate \[feature] with comprehensive tests:



Requirements: \[feature needs]

Context: \[existing code]



Provide implementation plus unit/integration/error tests."

```



\### Ask for explanations



\*\*Don't just ask for code, ask the AI to explain its decisions:\*\*



```

"Implement \[feature] with detailed explanations:



Requirements: \[needs]

Context: \[existing code]



Explain each major decision and potential issues."

```



\## Common crypto app errors



\### Transaction errors



\*\*When transactions fail, try this:\*\*



```

Pattern: "execution reverted" or "transaction failed"

Causes: Insufficient gas, invalid parameters, network congestion



Debug: "Transaction reverting: \[error]. Details: \[transaction object]. Help identify why."

```



\### Connection errors



\*\*When wallets won't connect, try this:\*\*



```

Pattern: "wallet not connected" or "provider not found"  

Causes: Missing extension, wrong network, state management issues



Debug: "Users can't connect: \[error]. Code: \[connection logic]. What to check?"

```



\### State errors



\*\*When your app's state gets messed up, try this:\*\*



```

Pattern: "Cannot read property of undefined" or infinite re-renders

Causes: Missing dependencies, race conditions, memory leaks



Debug: "State management issues: \[symptoms]. Code: \[component]. Fix patterns?"

```



\## More debugging tips



\### Compare working vs broken code



\*\*Try this when you have a working example:\*\*



```

"My code isn't working: \[paste broken code]



Working example: \[paste working code or link]



What's different and why might mine fail? How should I fix it?"

```



\### Break down complex problems



\*\*When the issue is complicated, try debugging piece by piece:\*\*



```

"Complex issue with \[feature]:



Part 1 - Basic functionality: \[code] - Does this work?

Part 2 - Integration: \[describe] - How should this integrate?

Part 3 - Edge cases: \[describe] - What cases to handle?



Debug each part systematically."

```



\### When something breaks later



\*\*If your feature worked before but now it's broken:\*\*



```

"Feature worked before but now broken:



Last working: \[commit/description]

Current error: \[error message]

Recent changes: \[list changes]



What change likely caused this regression?"

```
